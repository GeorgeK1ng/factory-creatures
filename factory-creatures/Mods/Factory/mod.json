Built by some settlers interested in inventions, maybe even some outcasts from the defeated Forge forces, that town is a center of freethinking now. </p><p style='font-size:18px; color:#002366; font-weight:bold;'>New Units & Buildings</p><p style='font-size:16px; color:#333333;'> Recruit technologically enhanced creatures like <b>Automatons</b>, <b>Termorons</b>, <b>Gunslingers</b>, and the mighty <b>Steam Dreadnoughts</b>. Expand your army further by upgrading to <b>Sentinel Automatons</b>, <b>Battle Termotrons</b>, <b>Sheriffs</b>, and <b>Steam Juggernauts</b>. Key buildings like the <b>Serpentarium</b> and <b>Saloon</b> bring a unique Wild West flair, allowing you to build an unstoppable wasteland force. </p><p style='font-size:18px; color:#002366; font-weight:bold;'>Creatures and Abilities</p><p style='font-size:16px; color:#333333;'> Factory creatures have a lot of interesting abilities: <b>Dreadnoughts</b> and <b>Juggernauts</b> use their laser ray to obliterate enemies, while <b>Bounty Hunters</b> and <b>Sheriffs</b> have <i>infinite first ranged retaliations</i>, making enemy shooters worse. <b>Rainbow Couatls</b> and <b>Crimson Couatls</b> excel with <i>immunities to many negative effects</i> and <b>Halfing Grenadiers</b> bring a lot of <i>explosions</i>. Together, these creatures combine strength and strategy in entirely new ways. </p><p style='font-size:18px; color:#002366; font-weight:bold;'>Lead the Wasteland warriors</p><p style='font-size:16px; color:#333333;'> With the <i>Factory</i>, embark on a journey that merges powers of nature and cutting-edge machines. Command unique heroes, harness the power of Lightning Rod, and field an army of wasteland creatures in your quest for dominance. Lead the Factory forces to win! </p>",
