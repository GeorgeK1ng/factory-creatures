The <span style='color:#002366; font-weight:bold;'>Factory HotA Creaturs</span> for VCMI allows players to use creatures without the town itself in 1.5.7 and adds an option to play the new town, Unofficial Factory, that uses a lot of content made by modding community. </p><p style='font-size:18px; color:#990000; font-weight:bold;'>Disclaimer</p><p style='color:#333333; font-size:15px;'> While the mod add Factory town and its creatures, it's different from the official HotA one and Ben Yan's port. If you want to play original Factory town, I suggest you to use Ben Yan's port. Mod differs from the official Factory by a lot. Most stats are made from the wiki info before the release, there are two third upgrade creatures and an alternative creature. Also you can build a second tier 2 dwelling to hire Rogues, who share their growth with growth of Mechanics. </p>",
